## How it works

A vending machine works by accepting payment, allowing the customer to select a product, and then dispensing that product automatically. Once payment is made, the machine verifies it, activates a motor to release the chosen item, and delivers it to a retrieval tray where the customer can collect it.

## How to test

Explain how to use your project
Unit Tests: Test individual components (coin recognition, bill validation, product dispensing, change calculation).
Integration Tests: Test interactions between components (coin mechanism, product dispenser).
End-to-End Tests: Simulate user actions (purchase, payment, error handling, accessibility).
